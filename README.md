This is a hobby project to build tools in Python to assist me in my job hunt. Right now I'm implementing: 

- A résumé builder that, surprisingly, I haven't been able to find online. Maybe there's a really sophisticated way to use a LibreOffice or Word template with fields to paste in e.g. employer history in the fields, but I'm not aware of it. Plus I want to learn to automate simple tasks in LO anyway. 

Eventually I might also implement: 

- Web scraper for certain job sites. 

Some TODOS: 
1. Since the style stuff isn't working for cell contents, try styling text outside of cell contents. This will give a clue as to how much of the horrible OpenOffice API does or doesn't pertain to text in cells.
